# Python Programming
* *This Program helps us to read 10 numbeers from a file. Write the even numbers and odd numbers to seperate files even.txt and odd.txt*
1. First, we create an empty list.
2. Then, we open the file numbers.txt in read mode.
3. Next, we iterate over each line in the file and append the line to the list.
4. Finally, we print the list.
